# iplanalysis
This is my second data analysis project.
In this project, I worked with IPL match data to understand player and team performance using Python.

The main aim was to practice data analysis on a real-world dataset and improve my visualization skills compared to my first project (restaurant sales analysis).

# Dataset
The project uses two CSV files:
matches.csv – contains match-level information
deliveries.csv – contains ball-by-ball data
Analysis Performed

# In this project, I analyzed:
Top 10 run scorers
Top 10 strike rates (minimum 100 balls faced)
Players with most sixes
Top 10 wicket takers (excluding run-outs)
Top 5 teams with most wins
Strike rate was calculated using:
Strike Rate = (Total Runs / Total Balls Faced) × 100

# Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Future Improvements
Season-wise analysis
Orange cap / Purple cap analysis
Creating an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
Adding more advanced statistic
